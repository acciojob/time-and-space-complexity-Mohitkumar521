<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

<p>
  Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures how the running time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input data. It helps us analyze and compare the efficiency of different algorithms. An algorithm with efficient time complexity performs well even for large input sizes, making it suitable for real-world applications. It's crucial to design algorithms that strike a balance between accuracy and speed, ensuring that they complete their tasks in a reasonable amount of time.

  Space complexity, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory an algorithm uses to solve a problem. It evaluates the extra space required by an algorithm relative to the size of the input data. Space complexity is often expressed using the notation O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. Algorithms with low space complexity are desirable as they optimize memory usage. For instance, when working with limited memory resources or in environments with constraints, such as embedded systems, efficient space utilization becomes essential. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a critical consideration in designing algorithms to ensure they don't cause memory-related issues or slowdowns.

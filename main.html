    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>When analyzing algorithms, one crucial aspect to consider is their <strong>time complexity</strong>. This refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. An algorithm is considered efficient if its time complexity grows at a reasonable rate as the input size increases. In other words, an efficient algorithm should ideally not take too long to execute even when dealing with larger inputs.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, <strong>space complexity</strong> is concerned with the amount of memory space an algorithm uses as the input size grows. It's represented using Big O notation, such as <strong>O(n)</strong>, where 'n' represents the input size. A space-efficient algorithm strives to minimize its memory usage while performing its tasks effectively. Managing space complexity is essential, especially in memory-constrained environments or when dealing with large datasets.</p>
